 <title>Home with the Dogs</title>
 <link>http://timefighters.org/news/narrative/home-dogs</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I stayed home the other day.  It was Good Friday, a good day to stay home.  I mostly stayed home because I was recovering from the Seder I went to at Temple Beth Hatfiloh.  Such a lovely community Seder, complete with Kosher wine from Israel. And those four glasses of it were only the start... So there I was, home alone, with the neighborhood dogs. And they were barking for hours. I don&amp;rsquo;t remember hearing dogs around here barking quite so much.   I guess I&amp;rsquo;m not usually home all day when my neighbors are out.  But they barked all day Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
