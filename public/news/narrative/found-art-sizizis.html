    <p>&quot;Arty&quot;, &quot;Arty&quot; &ndash; with that snooty accent on the &lsquo;t': &quot;Ar-tee&quot;; she said she's drinking ARTY!&nbsp; So here's where the mystery ends! He's been missing for weeks. They tried to tell me he'd probably just left town; they said: You know Arty, he never sticks around for long, and he usually pops up just when you thought you'd never see him again, but I didn't feel right about it this time.&nbsp; Something was in the air...it smelled to me like Arty was still in town...The snow had grounded us all, like a big blanket tucking the whole town in, no one was going anywhere...But the new coffee/tea joint was open.We could see the full frontal windows all steamed up: it seemed forbidding and beckoning all at once, &quot;704&quot; painted in big black numbers over the recessed doorway, which bore a hand painted notice: Open 24 hours.&nbsp; We went in, Merlin and I...The dark warm enveloped us, we became part of the steam...Straight ahead was a magnificent solid dark wood archway that seemed salvaged from a fin-de-siecle secret gentleman's club, the kind that had exclusive membership and was located beneath the main establishment.&nbsp; It also had an air of monastery: fat round columns and gothic arched recessed doorways to either side of the bar, ornate filigree, all dark rich polished wood, real wood, the kind they cut down first growth forests for: rich, burnished; it softens, muffles, absorbs, and breathes heart beat warm...we were drawn up to the counter.Merlin had been there the day before, so he went ahead and ordered some aromatic green tea&nbsp; from the barista.&nbsp; I became transfixed by the fixtures: atop the espresso machine, fine porcelain demitasse cups and saucers, each cup delicate and unique; the wood columns, thick as tree trunks, highly polished rich dark brown, seducing me to caress them.I finally stopped long enough to focus on the menu and peruse the selections.&nbsp; Layers of flavours and personalities; I chose tea: The Witching Hour.We found an acquaintance of ours seated at a table next to a steamy window.&nbsp; We sat far enough for privacy but near enough for exchange; we sat at and in more rich wood.It was after a few seasonal words together about the barrage of snow and the warm solstice atmosphere inside that she said:&nbsp; &quot;I'm drinking Ar-tee...&quot;She was so nonchalant, so devil-may-care about it!I whispered hoarsely to Merlin: Did you hear that?!?She didn't even seem to be aware of what she was saying!&nbsp; Arty, man, ARTY!&nbsp; He's been missing for WEEKS!He heard it.&nbsp; He chuckled at me and pushed his glasses up on his nose.But I was suspicious.His tea came before mine, and he sat sipping contentedly away...I, on the alert now, began to look around...The rich brown of the wood was seamlessly complimented by blood red: shiny highly-polished blood red walls and ceiling, alternating grey and blood red floor beams, blood like still wet red, saturating all the wood.&nbsp; It seemed to still be dripping...There seemed to be a small voodoo doll perched just above the doorway, over the first letter of a hand-painted sentence, very cryptic: Door to Remain Unlocked during Business Hours...hmmm....what does that mean?I noticed portholes all across the ceiling, some still open, their glass rounds hanging like suspended mirrors; this must be where they let it drip from; there, in the space above was where they mutilated the bodies, yes, where they mutilated Arty!&nbsp; They chopped him up and let it drip!&nbsp; Arty's blood was what they painted these walls with!My tea came: Who was I about to drink?But it was too late: the place was already winding it's little cloak around me, and in a trance of feverish thought I began to drink my brew: an earthy twiggy root tea...Merlin, having finished his tea, got up to order an Italian soda.I could feel the witches brew softening my bones, the aroma penetrating my neural pathways...maybe this was how they did it, just drew you in slowly, til the next thing you knew, YOU were on the menu...Menu: there was no menu, only teas and coffees: how are they gonna keep this place open, how are they gonna PAY for this place?The Italian soda finally came: violet/pomegranate, a decidedly provocative potion. Then, I noticed that there were pentagrams cut into the glass he was drinking from!I think: I'm aware, I'm awake; they're not gonna get me!Across the room I saw a low table festooned with solstice trim.&nbsp; It seemed to take on the shape of a winged gargoyle, mouth open, laughing at us all...we are his prey now...Arty, Arty...I bet they're filming us from the porthole that is hanging open behind the brewing counter!&nbsp; They're not gonna polish these walls with MY blood, no sirree! Still, I am loathe to leave; it is warm and wood in here; the floor sounds like an old saloon; my past lives well up: gun slinging proprietress, dancing girl to drunken tycoons; coven mastress.The brew has worked its way up to my roots now, and I am becalmed...The gargoyle is laughing joyously, the snow continues to fall, Arty is better off, and Merlin and I continue to sip into the darkness...At any rate, here is refuge from whatever it was, whatever it was that isn't really there anyway...I'll be back.</p>
