    <p><em>I think it was deliberate that we were made to look like we were just ridiculous girls parading around in our underwear. They refused to do serious interviews with us, they misprinted what we had to say, they would take our articles, and our fanzines, and our essays and take them out of context.</em> - Corin Tucker, Riot Grrrl Retrospective</p>
<p>I read this quote the same day I saw 3x3: New Work By West Coast Women Artists, part of the Olympia Film Festival at the Capitol Theater, and it spurred me to write this review. The issue of art not being taken seriously arose almost as soon as 3x3's filmmakers took to the stage for their Q&amp;A. One of the first questions they were asked, by a young man in the balcony, was: &ldquo;Who is your favorite cat?&rdquo; In response, Amber Smith cannily uttered the name of her cat and not another word. But soon after someone else asked if jokey questions in a Q&amp;A aren't a reflection of a tendency of many to not take women's art seriously. I was glad someone questioned the dynamics underlying the dumb-ass comment. Maybe the questioner was just looking for attention, or responding to the playfulness of the works of the last two filmmakers. But his delivery wasn't very funny, didn't convey a whole lot of respect, and brought an air of tension to the Q&amp;A session. So, this review is an attempt to pay respect to Vanessa O'Neill, Amber Smith, and Wynne Greenwood, as well as Bridget Irish who curated the show and led the Q&amp;A -- and to let those who weren't there in on the experience created by their moving pictures.</p>
<p>Vanessa O'Neill's trio of films came first, and sadly I missed all but most of the last film, Suspension. (Having been gone from Olympia for three years, I'd forgotten that between writing down PLUs and tare weights and bumping into old friends, a trip to the Co-op should be done with plenty of time to spare, especially on a Sunday afternoon). I walked into a theatre filled with total silence - a rare thing for the Capitol - and awash in a blue aura. Suspension was a 16mm double projection of shifting, dancing layers of dynamic blue, sometimes glimpses of the ocean, filling the screen. It took an initial moment to adjust from the busy lobby to O'Neill's vision, but was well worth it. Usually films are filled with talking, figures, and sound, but O'Neill's pairing of silence and image abstraction opened a wide space for its viewers to reflect on her art and its formation of meaning. To call her film painterly would neglect its movement and dynamism, but conveys a sense of why I appreciated it. It created a beautiful, encompassing aesthetic and visceral experience that really stimulated the imagination.</p>
<p>Amber Smith's films were disingenuously simple ruminations on family, growing up, and doing bad. Her opening vignette - a trickle of water slowly destroying a carefully built castle of sugar cubes - introduced a repeating theme that injected the urge to shock and destruct into mundane household activities. In both Caught and Unload, Smith filled the screen with things a mischievous and curious adolescent might delight in: making and burning a grid of marshmallows; lighting candles on a cake and them putting them out with a splash of milk; a snake opening its throat to swallow a mouse; flies buzzing on a squashed possum; the removal of a tampon. The slow, deliberate and nonchalant filming of these scenes were overlaid with seemingly unrelated confessional narration. However, the playfulness of the images and matter-of-fact presentation of the confessions combined into evocative reflections. In Caught, the narrator (I presume it was Smith) described her ill-treatment by her older sister; in Unload, several voiceovers confessed awful things they had done when they were younger, to siblings or pets. Although moving, these films kept a light touch and were really fun to watch. Plus, with so much out there about the innocence of children, they were a refreshing reminder that darkness is always something that kids discover, experiment, and sometimes relish. Finally, Caught, the middle of Smith's three films, was a nice look at adult mother-daughter relationships. It opened with a side shot of Smith's mom, mouth hanging slightly open and seemingly unaware of the camera on her, raising a tension about privacy and the gaze which continued through the film. In it, Smith and her mother sit or stand, usually looking at each other, and sometimes away. The shots are quite long, catching extended staring contests which Smith seems to usually win. Smith has the upper hand in the narrative as well, which consist of increasingly personal questions to her mother; however, when asked how old she was when she lost her virginity, her mom finally draws the line. By filming her mom in this way, Smith publicly interrogates her but also tenderly portrays their relationship. And by asking what has always been left unsaid, Smith reflects again on communication in growing up and shows how parents, too, grapple with darkness and how much to share with their kids.</p>
<p>I'm writing up Wynne Greenwood's movies last, and four days later, so my memory of them is sketchier, but they were a completely different but nice counterpoint to the other movies in this triad. As Greenwood stated in the Q&amp;A, there was a lot more artifice in her movies than those of O'Neill or Smith, but that's always been a big part of the fun of her work. Unlike Smith's movies, in which audio and video were always disconnected, Greenwood's characters dialogued, often right with the audience. Two out of the three shorts were mock news reports, complete with cheezy audio and graphics, where Greenwood and K8 Hardy played newscasters Henry and Henry (I forget their last names, but Hardy's characters' was a really good mouthful). The third short was the one pictured in the Film Fest program, and was more classic Greenwood, with her playing two characters at once, a la Tracy and the Plastics, which is always great. But the New Reports made a more lasting impression. The central prop - and, Greenwood said in the Q&amp;A, the central object in the conceptual development of the pieces - was an oversized, pink paper-mache microphone, which often obscured the faces of the Henry holding it. Both films offered wry comments on women in art and media, especially New Report (2006). A reportage of dialogue between Hardy, reporting from the street, and Greenwood, reporting in the studio -- actually a festival space in the Chelsea neighborhood of New York, where the piece was initially filmed live in front of an audience. Hardy searches through the neighborhood dumpsters, with great concern, for pieces of art which were rumored to have been thrown out by a woman artist. &nbsp;When finally they are found, they are each inscribed &ldquo;For Chelsea.&rdquo; Greenwood edited the live performance into a short film and I would have liked to see slightly longer shots of the pieces of art, given the build-up to finding them, and given that they seemed to offer commentary of their own. But the editing also highlighted the humor of the dialogue between Hardy and Greenwood, which kept New Report engaging and funny as well as reflective.</p>
<p>So, thanks to the filmmakers for showing their film and being in person to discuss it afterwards, and Bridget for making it all happen. That is all!</p>
