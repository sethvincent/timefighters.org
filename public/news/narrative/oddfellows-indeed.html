    <p>&ldquo;OUR MISSION:<br />To visit the sick, relieve the distressed, bury the dead, and educate the orphan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the Bee Colony Collapse Disorder Science Cafe gathering over a month ago, I met a man who I must call a good neighbor.</p>
<p>During the break, he and I began talking about Bees, and he shared a story about his own Bee colony collapse experience.&nbsp; At one point he said that he hadn&rsquo;t been to his Beekeeper meetings for a few years because of his cemetery meetings.&nbsp; Interested, I said: Cemetery meetings?<br />And with a straight face, he responded: I&rsquo;m an Oddfellow.<br />My head turned fully round to get a good look at him: A What?<br />A member of the Order of Oddfellows.<br />Now to my mind, any grown man, fairly big and strong too, who can say a thing like that, particularly after telling me he was going to play like a bee and pollinate his own plum trees, certainly must be odd.<br />I asked him to explain.<br />He told me that the Oddfellows are a fraternal order who care for Widows, Orphans, and Cemeteries.<br />My head cocked like a confused puppy; I&rsquo;ve read my Dickens, I know my history, I know this world:&nbsp; Who cares about widows and orphans? Nobody.<br />Oddfellows, indeed...<br />He then said that their three links are Friendship, Love, and Truth.<br />Well, at that, I was rendered speechless, and filled with curiosity and delight...<br />What a strange thing indeed, to meet a man, any man, in particular a large, warm, sparkling fellow at the Bee Keeping gathering, who says he cares about Widows, Orphans, and Cemeteries.&nbsp; And then says that he is dedicated to the principals of Friendship Love and Truth!<br />An Oddfellow indeed...<br />For the rest of the break we talked, and he told me a few things the order does locally:<br />During the summers, they provide free lunches for children who usually get free lunch during the school year.&nbsp; He said if these families can&rsquo;t afford lunch during the school year, they still can&rsquo;t during the summer.&nbsp; He detailed everything they&rsquo;d put into the lunch boxes, regretting not being able to put in fresh fruit because it&rsquo;s too expensive.&nbsp; He also had a cute story about putting in some clothes, including &ldquo;tighty-whiteys&rdquo;, which it turned out none of the boys would wear.&nbsp; This was funny to him, as when he was a poor youngster, he would&rsquo;ve loved to get some tighty-whiteys!&nbsp; To me, this was a most interesting fashion fact: boys have finally evolved (or regressed?) to boxers &ndash; I never did like tighty-whiteys, or tighty any other colors for that matter...yeesh.&nbsp; </p>
<p>He talked about building ramps in a disabled community, about parks the order has for its members to use, complete with camping facilities and bathrooms, one right here in Olympia, and he&rsquo;d already mentioned the care of their cemetery in Tumwater.&nbsp; I was intrigued, but it was time to get back to Bees.</p>
<p>After the Science Cafe was over, we sat and talked til the chairs were almost all put away.&nbsp; He introduced himself and we exchanged stories about our names.&nbsp; We walked out into the night air together, and he talked more about the Oddfellows: <br />The order used to be men only, until they instituted the Rebekahs (this happened in the 1850s, an enlightened move, all things considered).&nbsp; Now women are part of the lodge, and he spoke glowingly of all that they have brought to it.&nbsp; He said that at the Easter picnic the weekend before, the women had made everything so beautiful and brightened everything right up.&nbsp; He was enthusiastic about everything, a perfect ambassador for the Oddfellows.&nbsp; As we parted, he said if I wanted to know more, I could contact him.</p>
<p>I biked home easily, 8 miles in the moonlit night, my heart light, my head swirling with thoughts.&nbsp; He was talking about me and mine: I am, at this point, an orphan; my Mother was a widow from my early childhood; and what&rsquo;s more, her Mother, my Grandmother, was orphaned as a baby.<br />And Friendship, Love, and Truth?<br />Wow.<br />I had to know more.</p>
<p>I got home and went straight to the internet.&nbsp; Along with local info and wikipedia, and the site for the Independent Order of Oddfellows (ioof.org), I found a link to a book written all about the order in 1899: The Jericho Road, by W. Bion Adkins.</p>
<p>I include here some material written therein:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Odd-Fellowship is broad and comprehensive. It is founded upon that eternal principle which teaches that all the world is one family and all mankind are brothers. Unheralded and unsung, it was born and went forth, a breath of love, a sweet song that has filled thousands of hearts with joy and gladness. To the rich and the poor, the old and the young, at all times, comes the rich, sweet melody of this song of humanity to comfort and to cheer. For eighty years the light of Odd-Fellowship has burned before the world, a beacon to the lost, a comfort to the wanderer and a protection to the thoughtless.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;The mission of Odd-Fellowship, like that of the lowly Nazarene, is to replace the rule of might with the gentle influence of love, and to teach a universal fraternity in the family of man. To meet and satisfy and better keep alive the nobler elements of man&rsquo;s nature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, certainly in these days of self-aggrandizing projects, self-absorption and money chasing, anyone who subscribes to these tenets is odd.&nbsp; Does anybody really care this much anymore?&nbsp; And is it really possible that there are men and women who are that odd, right here in this town?<br />Yes; in fact they meet in downtown Oly twice a month.&nbsp; One thing my neighbor-friend told me was that this order has nothing to do with alcohol and hanging out drinking; they do not own a bar &ndash; which I gather is a mainstay of other fraternal orders.&nbsp; The more I read about them, the more I could see the Oddfellows are truly about good works and ennobling the spirit and lives of others, not just hanging out doing secret rituals - though there are some of those, but you gotta join to find out what they are.</p>
<p>After some time went by, I called this man, P.J., and when I told him I wanted to write something about the Oddfellows he said &ldquo;Oh, that would be wonderful!&rdquo;<br />Yes, wonderful.<br />So we planned to meet and have a little chat.</p>
<p>The day we were to meet, the rain was coming down hard, but as I was on the bus toward our appointment the clouds broke and the yellow warmth of the sun began to pour through.</p>
<p>We met at Bayview and I was a bit late.&nbsp; He was talking with a woman who he introduced as someone he&rsquo;d been friends with since first grade.&nbsp; As I barely know anyone from high school anymore, this was impressive.&nbsp; She chirped up right away that P.J. had always protected her against the other kids; he blew that off.&nbsp; She went on with a few stories, clearly conveying a fond and playful relationship with him.</p>
<p>He and I got some coffee and went to sit upstairs.&nbsp; By then the sun was sparkling on the waters, blue and bright out the windows all around us.&nbsp; He was wearing a light blue Oddfellows shirt and jacket, embroidered with the Friendship, Love and Truth links.</p>
<p>One of the first things he did was tell on himself with regards to the woman he&rsquo;d introduced me to: he said that at one point in his young school life, he&rsquo;d almost gotten caught up in picking on her along with the other fellows (mean rather than odd, I would say), until his teacher called him out for it.&nbsp; She said &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t just be friends with someone when it is convenient for you&rdquo;, and this was enough for him to stop himself.&nbsp; Early signs of oddness, I guess.</p>
<p>After talking about how the weather had shaped our days &ndash; despite the wind and rain, he&rsquo;d gone fishing with his brother - we got around to talking about the Oddfellows.</p>
<p>He clarified that the summer lunch program isn&rsquo;t happening anymore because the school district is taking care of it now.&nbsp; Meanwhile, the order helped build the playground at Roosevelt Elementary School, and put on a cookout when a playground in Boston Harbor was built.&nbsp; They&rsquo;ve also offered up the park they have to the Boys and Girls club for an overnight event, and they plan to cook up breakfast and a picnic for the kids.&nbsp; As I write this, they are having a full out Memorial Day service, complete with Washington State Patrol 3-gun salute and cookout in the cemetery in Tumwater.</p>
<p>It might seem strange to be caretakers for a cemetery, but for many of the living, a cemetery is a very important place in which to commune with those who&rsquo;ve passed on.&nbsp; And the order is about working with the living, caring for their needs, making life a bit easier.&nbsp; I know from the internet and from P.J. that there are other causes the Oddfellows contribute to, including an orphanage in Cambodia, scholarships for education, and a tree planting project called Living Legacy.&nbsp; They support an arthritis fund, a diabetes fund, and a fund for eyeglasses for developing countries.&nbsp; And in general, they look out for each other in times of trouble - something we call community.</p>
<p>One frustrating note was about how the order also wants to help build up ramps for elderly people, but liability issues prevent them from going ahead with their plans.<br />Isn&rsquo;t that crazy?&nbsp; A group of willing hands and hearts, but our hyper sue-crazy culture ties them up, leaving people in need with no help at all.&nbsp; How we thwart those who care.</p>
<p>He talked some about how crazy this culture is, that we go nuts about 2 deaths from swine flu, closing schools, etc., when year round probably 31,000 elders die from the regular flu.</p>
<p>P.J. certainly is an ambassador for Oddfellowship.&nbsp; He exudes warmth and delight.&nbsp; He said that the Oddfellows are some of the most caring guys and gals he&rsquo;s ever met, and judging by him I can only imagine.&nbsp; Men who care.&nbsp; People who care.&nbsp; We need people who care.</p>
<p>He told me that he&rsquo;d worked in the Crisis Clinic for about 12 years.&nbsp; That in itself is heartening.&nbsp; A man, a Father, a Grandfather, and Great Grandfather, working in a clinic for folks in crisis mode who don&rsquo;t know where else to turn.&nbsp; He talked about working there with many Evergreen students, and said he loved how much they cared about people and really wanted to help.&nbsp; He loved how they would try to shock him with things, but he said he&rsquo;d heard it all and said it all before. I wondered how the kids felt around him.&nbsp; I found him to be warm and caring, as well as a bit mischievous.</p>
<p>Along with much general wisdom and insight, he shared his belief that each day a person has an opportunity to decide how they&rsquo;re going to be: optimistic and open, or negative and scowling.&nbsp; He said, when you wake up in the morning and you look in the mirror, if you don&rsquo;t like what you see, well...you can live with it, or you can change it.&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t mean folks who are in difficult straits &ndash; those are people he seeks to help &ndash; he meant types like I&rsquo;ve known, who do wake up everyday scowling, who don&rsquo;t like themselves yet don&rsquo;t take responsibility for the way they are.<br />I wonder how the world would be if those people woke up and decided they didn&rsquo;t like what they saw and so they changed it?<br />Just since I&rsquo;ve met him and read more about the Oddfellows, I&rsquo;ve changed.&nbsp; At the very least I question each scowl that crosses my face during the course of a day.&nbsp; What good is that scowl doing anyone?&nbsp; Doing me?&nbsp; None.&nbsp; Of course, a habit is hard to break, and knowledge can be a weighty thing that can lead to bitter cynicism, but...there are still beautiful things in life, and a smile will do more for someone than a scowl will...</p>
<p>Another piece of wisdom that P.J. imparted to me arose when I brought up some of my personal reservations about language in the Oddfellows pledge (Fatherhood of God), and even the fact that they say the pledge of allegiance at their meetings.&nbsp; He admitted that people have issues with some of these parts of membership in the order, but suggested that sometimes you put up with little annoyances because the bigger picture is what is really important to you.&nbsp; I felt this could be related to many things in life: relationships, careers, journeys of many kinds...</p>
<p>Soon enough it was time for us to go.&nbsp; He regretted that time had flown so, as he&rsquo;d thought a visit to their park would&rsquo;ve been nice.&nbsp; As we walked out the front doors of Bayview, he mused about his general attitude when he walks through Olympia: he always says Hi to people, but they seem to veer away from him like he&rsquo;s strange; as he said &lsquo;strange&rsquo;, I said &lsquo;crazy&rsquo;, and we both laughed: given how often I&rsquo;ve noticed a complete lack of acknowledgment of each other on the streets of our small town, I could just imagine how crazy he must seem to people: a big warm friendly honey bee, buzzing about town saying Hi; I&rsquo;m sure folks don&rsquo;t know what to make of him!</p>
<p>To me, he exemplified friendship and truth.&nbsp; He was honest about his own shortcomings and interested in my story and well-being.&nbsp; He was open to all of my own heathen reservations and thoughts, and while he freely expressed his own views, he held no prejudice that I could detect.&nbsp; He spoke his own mind, and was open to mine.<br />He was full of stories and joy and warmth. Once again I biked home easily, my heart lighter for our meeting.</p>
<p>He sent me an email soon after, inviting me to visit the park before I finished writing this article.<br />We again met at Bayview.&nbsp; This time we had a light rain.&nbsp; We put my bike into the back of his truck, and off he drove.&nbsp; We headed out toward Johnson&rsquo;s Point, a first in that direction for me.&nbsp; The way became more rural than I&rsquo;d realized it gets around here.&nbsp; The dogwoods were in bloom and lined the route.&nbsp; He told me about the dogwood blight that went through the area some years back, said that only now are they growing healthy again on his own property.&nbsp; </p>
<p>We arrived at the gate to the park and he got out of the truck to opened it.&nbsp; The park is a lovely strip of land surrounded by trees that goes right down to the water of the Puget Sound and faces Anderson Island.&nbsp; There are 8-10 campsites, with hook-ups for RVs, bathrooms, and a nice spot for an outdoor fire just by the beach. <br />The sky was low with clouds, the air was wet, everything seen through a misty fog.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t mind at all, as I&rsquo;m strange and love these kinds of days here.&nbsp; He regretted the weather, though, telling me that on a clear day, you can see Mt. Rainier; on a very clear day, you can see Mt. St. Helens; and when it&rsquo;s especially clear, you can see Mt. Adams.&nbsp; He tried to help me orient myself to where we were in relation to downtown, but understanding which way was north was hard enough.&nbsp; I needed to scrutinize a map later on.</p>
<p>We walked up from the fire pit and went inside the lodge park building used for gatherings of people.&nbsp; There is a big brick fireplace, and a kitchen, and in good weather, the whole front can be opened up.&nbsp; P.J. is the gardener of the flowers in front of the building.&nbsp; On that rainy day, the daffodils were just beginning to droop and crisp up, and he said he&rsquo;d be having to go to work on the next round of planting soon.</p>
<p>As it was raining slightly and not much of a day for a stroll by his standards, our visit was short.&nbsp; We went back through the gate and P.J. dropped me home.&nbsp; When we&rsquo;d met at Bayview the first time round, he&rsquo;d made a point of apologizing to me for not offering to give me a ride home after the Science Cafe, especially as it was so late and dark out.&nbsp; But he didn&rsquo;t have his truck with him that night so he couldn&rsquo;t, and he&rsquo;d felt bad about that.&nbsp; Geez, I&rsquo;ve got friends who don&rsquo;t even offer me a ride home from downtown, let alone all the way across town, so the mere mention of it was endearing.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Nowadays it&rsquo;s so easy to get cynical and give in to profanity and postmodern emptiness, and for many of us, there are aspects of &ldquo;joining&rdquo; anything that are off putting.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;ve begun to wonder whether wallowing in apathy, disdain, or even violent confrontation can really do anyone any good? Maybe there&rsquo;s something to action in community and caring for each other that is simple and real, and makes a difference. <br />Though I couldn&rsquo;t see myself pledging allegiance to any organization, or flag, or even perhaps person, I can respect the notion of a group of people who pledge themselves to an order founded on the ideals of being a good Samaritan; I can respect the integrity of pledging allegiance over the principals of Friendship, Love, and Truth.&nbsp; These are three things worth dying for.&nbsp; Or, as I rethought in the glow of a new friendship, three things worth living for.&nbsp; In fact, Friendship, Love, and Truth are the three things, the three ideals that I <em>would</em> pledge my allegiance to.</p>
<p>Having met this one member of the Order of Oddfellows, who is a bright spirited and caring person, I say: if he vouches for the others, I believe him.&nbsp; His way of being has already inspired me, in many moments, to remember my higher brighter self, and take it into the world with me.<br />May we all aspire to be such odd fellows as to care to brighten the way for our fellow brethren and sistren.</p>
<p>If you want to contact the Order of the Oddfellows, you can call 360.352.8601, or write 3802 Cleveland Ave SE, Tumwater, Washington, 98501.</p>
