<p class="rtecenter"><em>(album review)</em></p>
<p class="rtejustify">We here at <em>Timefighters</em> are living a lie. We''ve known it all along, however, only an ocean of drink could possess us to admit this in the company of others. We wake up every morning blinded by the futility of our struggle. It''s not the sun blaring through our curtainless windows that blinds us, it is Time. We can fight Time all we want, but Time will always win. No matter what weapons we wield, no matter what inventions we mother. In the same vein as umbrellas fighting rain, or the Golden Gate Bridge fighting California''s sink into the ocean, Time will always win. That is the lesson we can garner from Paleo''s new (and old) album, <em>Pedestrian Crossing</em> (Little Egypt Records).</p>
<p>It was conceived in the summer of 2005, the sophomore effort meant to compliment his first record, Misery Missouri, which was recorded over the length of 2004 in a barn in Osceola, Missouri. <em>Pedestrian Crossing</em> was abandoned on April 16th, 2006 when Strackany followed the butterfly whim that quickly metamorphosed into the year-long saga of writing a song every day referred to as <em>The Song Diary</em>. Three years later, in the latter half of 2008, Strackany made the opposite decision. Rather than pursuing material penned after the epic struggle of circadian songwriting, he chose to revisit the orphaned <em>Pedestrian Crossing</em>. Have you ever tried slipping into a pair of three-year-old pants? They probably don''t fit anymore, and if they do, then they''re probably out of style. And if they''re not, then they probably just feel strange, as if the lower half of a ghost has made them its home. So are they still worth wearing? On a macro scale, this is the question Strackany faced upon revisiting <em>Pedestrian Crossing.</em> Furthermore, this is how Paleo steps into the empirical, insect maw of Time, &amp;it is why we''ve awarded Strackany the title of Honorary Timefighter (which unfortunately translates into Honorary Failure). The album opens like the trepidatious creak of a doorway leading to a very secret place. Imagine the wardrobe that leads to Narnia: who''d ever believe that such a world could exist behind all of those coats? &quot;Narcissus,&quot; Strackany taunts in a warbling croon, &quot;you will sleep in a normal bed / you will clean up like all the rest / when the party is through.&quot; The song builds into a symphony of meticulous details, setting a precedent for the album. And like using an old meaning to describe a new word, &quot;Narcissus&quot; redefines Strackany''s artistry. Of course, the necessary Paleo staples are quite present: his sandpaper howl that is the fountainhead of yearning, and an cache of sharp, poetic turns. &quot;You''re the man of the hour&quot; Strackany bludgeons onto the grave of the mythical Narcissus, &quot;you''re just the man of the hour.&quot;&nbsp; The record blooms onward into a jawing, tinkering odyssey. Each layer has been kissed by the love of an intimate design; it''s as full and realized as a renaissance painting. This is a dramatic departure from the aesthetic of <em>The Song Diary </em>where, due to the technical constraints of recording while on tour, flaws were treated as guests. In the December 9th installment, &quot;Mournful and Slow,&quot; the song is accented with a false start by Strackany as well as an all-out halt when a resident tramples down the stairs, then asks, &quot;You weren''t recording, were you?&quot; But true to Paleo''s demeanor, <em>Pedestrian Crossing</em> is all heart. It''s not the youthful whispers and examinations that punctuate <em>Misery Missouri</em> (&quot;What is Love,&quot; &quot;Next Train&quot;) nor is it the parched elegies of the <em>Song Diary </em>(&quot;The Boat of Being Alive,&quot; for instance). Rather, <em>Pedestrian Crossing</em> is the intricate sculpture of a body caught between motions, built to honor the many faces of love. Following a five-minute instrumental interlude of sawing cellos and little beats, <em>Pedestrian Crossing</em> meets it''s marrow with &quot;The Crosswalk.&quot; Strackany poses a series of rhetorical questions such as, &quot;what if the social contract snaps,&quot; &quot;what if the the cure just makes it worse,&quot; and &quot;what if the bad guys get the bomb.&quot; The accordion moans and cymbal hisses creep around these concerns like shadows tip-toeing around in an attic. The only answer Paleo offers is to &quot;put one foot in front of the other,&quot; with full&nbsp; awareness of the threats that these questions insinuate. Even though it''s scary, even though it''s an impossible distance, even though barbarous automobiles want to dent their bumpers with your face, you have to walk to the other side of the street. You have to get there. All throughout <em>Pedestrian Crossing</em>, Strackany''s voice is noticeably more weathered than his previous recordings.&nbsp; He doesn''t sing, rather, he purges the words from his heart. At times it sounds as though his voice itself were in pain, which seems appropriate more often than not. Although it''s surely the result of relentless touring over the past three years, it adds a unique level of sincerity that might have been absent had this record been produced at it''s conception. There''s an irony involved, like reading a transcript of one of the early Bob Dylan radio interviews while listening to his harrowing T<em>ime Out of Mind</em> number, &quot;Not Dark Yet.&quot; <em>Pedestrian Crossing</em> is certainly Paleo''s struggle to fit into old clothes. When he wails &quot;God bless marijuana / let it bury the fire / in oceans of smoke,&quot; in &quot;You Don''t Have to Go, &quot;it''s easy to imagine Strackany awkwardly tugging at the belt loops of an old pair of pants, ill-ftted, and littered with patched-up holes. It''s easy to see him squirming in the shirt of a band he no longer listens to beneath the mop of an antiquated hairstyle. <em>Pedestrian Crossing</em> doesn''t defeat Time. Rather, Time defeats <em>Pedestrian Crossing.</em> The three-year span between writing and recording is what gives the album its character. It''s the voice of angst carried through the breath of wisdom. Time makes them one sound.&nbsp; This odd marriage leaves <em>Pedestrian Crossing</em> impossible to place. It doesn''t belong in the past any more than it belongs in the present. It''s a transient ghost, weaving in an out of places searching for a home. It''s not direction nor the destination that makes this search profound, but the distance. The album closes with the song, &quot;Me for Myself,&quot; which meditates on a series of questions in a similar similar vein to &quot;The Crosswalk.&quot; It''s a dated diary entry, or a geranium forced to bloom out of season. Since Strackany originally penned the words, &quot;When will I be free enough to leave / this pointless town,&quot; he has played hundreds of shows in cities all across the United States. Yet, three years wiser, here he is asking the same question. What things stay true? What does it take to make something true again? Time will always win. By the end of the song, in a bit of situational irony, Strackany poses, &quot;when will I be brave enough to put / the past in its place?&quot;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="rtejustify"><strong>EDITOR'S NOTE:</strong>At Timefighters, we are ardent in the struggle to conquer time. It''s not a quest for immortality, rather, it''s a fight for the present. At the end of 2008, Stephen Hawking unveiled a truer face for this menace with the Corpus Clock: an four-foot gold dial with no hands upon it''s face. Instead there are blinking L.E.D. lights to indicate the position of the present hour, minute and second. Rather than a &quot;coo-coo&quot; sound or a &quot;dong&quot; to note the passing of each hour, the <a href="http://biscoitoecha.files.wordpress.com/2008/09/corpus_clock.jpg">Corpus Clock </a>drops a chain into a wooden coffin. An enormous grasshopper progresses around the perimeter of the clock, snapping it''s jaws closed on every minute, devouring them, using its digestive juices to break them apart. At <em>Timefighters</em> we document moments in life in an effort to preserve them, and those are the stones we throw at Time. But Time always gets the last laugh. There''s no avoiding it. But Paleo offers a potential concession. Something we''re not quite sold on, but it''s a possibility we hadn''t imagined before. In &quot;Time Won''t Forget,&quot; Strackany suggests, &quot;Time won''t forget / It hammers at your heart / Time has only this to say / open your eyes&quot; Time will undoubtedly swallow you whole. It will swallow everything you know, but in the process Time will remember you. It will remember all the things you''ve seen, and find a place for them in its ever-expansive belly, so long as you open your eyes to see them.</p>
