    <p>A wonderful thing called Science Cafe is happening on second tuesdays each month at Barnes &amp; Noble.&nbsp; It is based on a model from the UK, where people with and without science backgrounds get together to hear about and discuss issues that affect their lives &ldquo;locally as well as globally&rdquo;.&nbsp; This tuesday, I went to my first one because it was about Bees, and I love Bees.&nbsp; Specifically, the presentation was about Bee Colony Collapse disorder.</p>
<p>Bees are &ldquo;disappearing&rdquo;, (along with the fish, and the birds), and this is surely a scary development. Beesides that, Bees are wonderful, in and of themselves: they pollinate flowers and trees, they make honey, and they make delicious soothing sounds on hot summer days. I&rsquo;d Been looking forward to this evening for weeks. </p>
<p>I read that the first Science Cafe was about chocolate, and there weren&rsquo;t enough chairs to go around.&nbsp; This time there were probably 50 chairs set up over in the Cookbook Nook.&nbsp; I arrived about half an hour early and sat up in the third row so I could see and hear clearly.&nbsp; There were a number of older women there already, and a few older men, as well as some college age and younger folks.</p>
<p>As I got settled in, I heard the women in front of me getting deeper and deeper into conversation.&nbsp; Some of them knew each other from before, but they were also making new connections.&nbsp; A few had their knitting out, and they were talking about knitting socks, about wool and yarn, and about spinning their own.&nbsp; And, of course, they talked about Bees: Bees in old oak stumps, Bees in their gardens. </p>
<p>I slowly noticed the older men around me; men with weathered faces, sharp silver, white, and black hair, farmers hands: thick strong fingers, cracked and ingrained with earth.&nbsp; One older man wearing suspendered pants had on a Pierce County Beekeepers hat, complete with picture of Bee.&nbsp; What is cuter than an old farmer man wearing a Beekeepers hat? (pcbeekeepers.org)</p>
<p>Eventually there were about 80 people spreading out from the Cookbook Nook, all ages and dress, from farmer to average to high school to Greener effect.</p>
<p>The lecture began.&nbsp; Well I can&rsquo;t really call it a lecture because as much as this man talked, folks were not timid about interjecting.&nbsp; Not rudely, just in normal contributory fashion.&nbsp; The format for the evening was: first the speaker, then a break to fill up our coffees, then re-gathering to open up the floor.</p>
<p>The presenter was Bob Bower, of Four Bs farm (fourbsfarm.com).&nbsp; As his booming voice attested, he was a former Coast Guard officer; he is also the American Farm Bureau Representative for Washington.&nbsp; I believe he is also affiliated with Oly Beekeepers Association, who meet once a month (second Mondays) at Roosevelt Elementary School; their informational pamphlets were on his display table, along with honeycombs and bee houses and frames and Bee starter kits.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Though not too tall, he was a fairly big man; not someone I would associate with bee keeping, but what do I know?&nbsp; As the evening progressed, I found much to surprise me about my fellow Bee enthusiasts.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to know where to begin writing all that I learned during those few hours.&nbsp; For starters, in case you don&rsquo;t know, Bees are disappearing by the millions, and no one really knows why.&nbsp; Not only does this affect our honey supply, it affects our entire food supply, not to mention the lives of the Bees.&nbsp; Potentially 1/3 of our food supply is threatened, as well as all of the honey.&nbsp; And, without the Bees, who will/how will we pollinate our fruit trees and our flowers?</p>
<p>There are all kinds of viruses spreading around, and throat mites, and deadly pesticides, and beetles that lay eggs in the honey, but no one knows what is making 80% of colonies in various places just disappear.&nbsp; No dead bodies, just suddenly, no more Bees. </p>
<p>Some use the term &ldquo;absconding&rdquo;, which basically means taking off. Bob Bower suggested it might be mass suicide when the adults perceive the colony isn&rsquo;t going to make it. </p>
<p>He went on to give details about Beekeeper practices, viruses, and mites.<br />Viruses and mites and beetles have been spreading amongst Bee colonies.&nbsp; One batch of Small hive beetles were possibly spread via rotting melons left at the Southern border.&nbsp; Now there are these beetles all across the Southern U.S. and they lay eggs in the honey and turn it to slime...eeeeeoooo....</p>
<p>The hope is that some of the problems that affect Bees from warmer climates won&rsquo;t survive up here.&nbsp; However something like tracheal mites need three weeks of 70 degree days and a menthol treatment, and when do we get three weeks of 70 degree days?</p>
<p>Some of the racially loaded nomenclature got too funny for me.<br />For instance:&nbsp; The African Honey Bee &ndash; also known as the &ldquo;killer Bee&rdquo; - was first brought to South America; from there, it escaped and came north.&nbsp; Now there are African Honey Bees all over the Southern United States.&nbsp; As opposed to &ldquo;regular&rdquo; European colonies of about 40-60,000 Bees, where only about 50 guard Bees will &ldquo;discourage you, or chase you&rdquo;, the African Bee colonies are vicious: &ldquo;every bee will come after you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And African Bees can intermix with European Bees!&nbsp; And eventually, all the drones can become African (oh no; miscegenation!).&nbsp; And the African Bees will kill the off the other swarms and just move in!</p>
<p>(Another amusing bit of nomenclature is the IAPV virus: the &ldquo;Israeli Acute Paralysis Virus&rdquo;...I don&rsquo;t even know where to begin...)</p>
<p>This intermingling of Bees has other problems too.&nbsp; If Bees infected with viruses visit colonies where, say, nurse Bees are more susceptible to infection, perhaps due to exposure to something like chemicals used to treat corn (called neonicotinoids - banned by France and Germany), the nurse Bees will in turn infect the entire brood (who knew there were such things as nurse Bees?).&nbsp; Then perhaps when the adult Bees realize that the whole brood is infected they just take off.</p>
<p>Another kind of problem with intermixing arises when, say, the Commercial Beekeepers move tons of Bees to California for almond pollination; if there is anything wrong with any of those Bees, within one year, it&rsquo;ll be across the states (does this sound familiar?).</p>
<p>Throughout the evening there were mentions of things like moving colonies to far off places to pollinate foreign orchards (for instance moving Bees from Australia to here), moving the Queen Bee to get the rest to follow (Beeknapping anyone?), and switching the Queens from colony A &amp; B to see what happens: oh, virus in colony B goes down, but in colony A it goes up; let&rsquo;s switch &lsquo;em back for awhile, see what happens.&nbsp; Oh, they&rsquo;re getting sick again in colony B, etc...And all the crap they do testing Bees for viruses and mites.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s a nice quote from a report I read online: </p>
<p>&ldquo;They also measured the amount of virus in each bee. Surprisingly, they found that the virus in mite-infested Bees rapidly increased to extremely high levels when the bee was exposed to the bacteria. <strong>The virus levels in mite-free bees did not change when the bee was injected with bacteria.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;We checked Bob&rsquo;s colonies for tracheal mites by collecting older foragers: those that have frayed wings and a bald thorax. <strong>We removed their heads and first pair of legs and examined the tracheal trunks that are visible in &ndash; &ldquo;</strong></p>
<p>Hell, it sounds like slavery meets nazi genetic experiments to me!&nbsp; Very disturbing; it&rsquo;s enough to make me vegan! </p>
<p>During the break I wound up in conversation with my seat neighbor.&nbsp; He explained some of the finer details to me and then he told me about losing his own hives.&nbsp; He said one August he was out in his pasture, and there were lots of Bees in the hives, lots of honey, and lots of Bees in the field.&nbsp; But the next day, they were all gone.&nbsp; No dead bodies were lying around, the Bees were just gone.&nbsp; He said: &ldquo;It was &ldquo;scary&rdquo;.&nbsp; He said he used to have 80,000 Bees, which pollinate his orchards and fill his pastures, but now he only has about 15,000.&nbsp; And this big older farmer man said with a twinkle in his eye that without the Bees, he will have to get his wife&rsquo;s paintbrush out and pollinate his own plum trees!&nbsp; A saucy sight, no doubt, but hardly sustainable on a large scale.</p>
<p>When we all came back from the break, the folks in the audience had plenty to say.&nbsp; One man had traveled to India and Pakistan to study Bees, and he said there are hundreds of Bee species there.&nbsp; He wondered about the lack of genetic diversification in our Bees, and our Bee breeding/keeping practices. </p>
<p>People mentioned using local Bees, called Mason Bees.&nbsp; These Bees are better for short-range pollination, especially in backyards, and they are solitary Bees, meaning they don&rsquo;t swarm and are therefore safer for families to have (but they don&rsquo;t make honey).&nbsp; Typically, US Agricultural practice is large scale and uses honey Bees, which require more commitment and are more dangerous as they do swarm.</p>
<p>Another man brought up the potato famines, and how so much of that crop was wiped out due to the practice of only growing one kind of potato.&nbsp; He was probably the 4th person who brought this issue of lack of diversity up in some way or another, and he suggested that these problems stem from ending genetic diversification by centralizing &ndash; using &ldquo;this modern model&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t help but bring up the global trade part of this modern model, and how we mess with the environment when we stop living with our local species, mentioning the melons from South America that might have brought in the beetle infestations - did I throw in something about what happened with the Colonists and the Natives a few hundred years ago?</p>
<p>It was near this point that one of the high moments of the evening, and possibly one of my favourite moments anywhere, occurred.&nbsp; Bob Bowers began almost to defend, more like bypass this line of reasoning that continued to come up from these farmers; this constant allusion to the combination of mono crop practices and global shipping of species and foods compounding, possibly creating many of these problems.&nbsp; He said something like, Well, that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ve got now, that&rsquo;s the kind of situation we&rsquo;re in, this is the way the world is currently run, this is just the way it is; at which point I, in typical fashion, blurted out &ldquo;Well we gotta CHANGE that!&rdquo;, only to realize that about 7 other people in my immediate vicinity blurted it out at the same time, while rumblings of assent could be heard from at least 15 others.&nbsp; </p>
<p>This was a fiery and adamant, as well as informed and aware, group of people.&nbsp; I felt proud to be sitting amidst them.&nbsp; I felt like they knew something, like they cared, like they&rsquo;d get riled up enough to do something!</p>
<p>During the break my neighbor had told me that years ago there were only 15-20 people at his Beekeepers meetings; this week there were 80 people.&nbsp; He said he thinks it&rsquo;s because of these developments, people are concerned about the way things are going &ndash; going going gone...</p>
<p>The last few comments I took note of followed quite sadly: first, that colonies of Bats are disappearing also; and second was a quote from one of the farmer/Beekeeper dudes: &ldquo;Industrialized practices poison everything, poison everything&rdquo;.</p>
<p>As sad as the situation is, I heard a few beauties in there too.&nbsp; Bob Bowers himself said at least two of them.&nbsp; The first thing was: if you wanna do something, &ldquo;Rip Out Your Lawns, and Plant Something that Blooms.&rdquo; (I wonder if he would agree to make a bumper sticker out of that?)<br />He also told a short vignette later, about normal Bee conditions/Bee-haviour.&nbsp; He was talking about how, after having your hive for about 2 weeks, there comes that first time the Bees come out; they all fly around their hives for awhile, &ldquo;getting the lay of the land&rdquo;.&nbsp; He said: &ldquo;The first year it happened to me, I just laid down on the ground and looked up and listened to that hum&rdquo;.<br />You had to see this short stout man - more like a hog farmer or, exactly, a Coast Guard vet with a booming voice - leaning his head back, reminiscing about lying under the sky, under the hum of a hive of Bees...<br />My neighbor had also spoken with similar affection about his Bees.<br />These men seemed unlike your average men.&nbsp; They seemed a bit twinkled, pollinated, nectareyesed by the Bees.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>It was so heartening to be sitting with a group of people, especially so many men, who are obviously deeply in tune with their lands, with the flowers, and the needs of the trees, and of us all, and of the interconnectedness of everything we do and of our whole planet.&nbsp; And it was so rousing to hear their defiant responses to the of-late status-quo.&nbsp; </p>
<p>As I finally write this up, the so-called &ldquo;Swine Flu&rdquo; is wavering on becoming pandemic &ndash; world-wide massive scale.&nbsp; Us and the Bees.</p>
<p>Will we ever figure it out?&nbsp; Maybe not in time; maybe it&rsquo;ll all balance itself out at some point.&nbsp; But at the very least, at that Science Cafe I enjoyed the company of people who care about Bees and about how we conduct ourselves on this planet.</p>
<p>*a really good site for more in-depth information and solutions is:</p>
<p>xerces.org</p>
<p>The next lecture I&rsquo;m going to make it to is in June, about how mushrooms can save the planet!</p>
<p>See you there?<br />&nbsp;</p>
