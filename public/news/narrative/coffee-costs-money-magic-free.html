    <p><strong>Sizizis' all-nite grand opening--every kind of ghost was present. </strong>-Otis Pig<strong> </strong>There are times when the very last place in the world I''d like to be is home. For one thing, I feel like an abundance of home leads to an absence of world. What I mean is this: every morning I watch Mt. Rainier emerge from the clouds through my window, but the wooden frame mounts that mountain like some landscape painting, &amp;suddenly that''s all it means to me. I can''t hear a word that Mt. Rainier says, because I am too far away. My windowpane filters that sound.</p>
<p>Even simpler is that my <em>real</em> home happens to be Spokane, Washington. The gross adolescence I had to climb out of back there was like a mucky tar that traps&nbsp; dinosaurs who aren't paying attention. Places like that will teach you real quick that &quot;home&quot; is just a four letter word. My surrogate h-o-m-e, the Finger Complex, is superior in every way except for one: the house refuses to depend on it's heating system to keep warm. So I spend the whole day shivering in my chair, sometimes wearing two sweaters.Even simpler still is the fundamental loneliness that is intrinsic to all human beings. There is no place I am more aware of this feeling than late at night in my room, shivering between the sheets. There''s no heat in this home. The only way I can make myself warm is by trapping my own body heat with these blankets. That fundamental loneliness often appears as a faint sting in the center of my chest. It''s usually the last thing I feel before I drift into sleep. &quot;There must be a solution for this.&quot; I think to myself, &quot;There must be a place that I can go, at all hours of the night, to avoid looking into the eyes of this horrible truth.&quot;As fate should have it, I am the first customer at Olympia's new 24-hour cafe, Sizizis.The name is a made-up palindrome with no assigned meaning. It looks the same upside-down as it does right-side-up. Otherwise, it''s kind of obnoxious &amp;hard to say. At first glance it looks like &quot;Sizzler's.&quot; If it were up to me, I'd have named this place &quot;Wolfsmane Hub.&quot; The barista (who I will keep nameless because if too many people knew such a lovely person worked there, there'd be a line halfway around the block &amp;she''d never get any rest) makes me a lavender mocha for three dollars &amp;fifty cents. She makes a joke about pinning the the five dollar bill I give her onto the wall in commemoration of this maiden transaction. Later, the owners of the cafe reciprocate that joke, however, my five-dollar bill remains un-tacked to the wall. The foliage in this establishment runs a high risk of malnutrition. For one thing, all the windows are still coated in plastic from when they spray-painted the trim in a deep, vampiric crimson. Occasionally a figure passes by one of the windows outside, &amp; their faint silhouette says &quot;ghost&quot; more than &quot;human.&quot; For another thing, the dim lighting (akin to a candlelit chamber) seems to do nothing for the health of these potted plants. I expect dead or wilting leaves the next time I come here. These elements, compounded with the staff's well-coordinated dress of choice: black, vaudeville gowns &amp; jackets with long coattails, further develop the atmosphere of&nbsp; an aristocratic, turn-of-the-century opium den. The smoke from burning incense helps, too. So I imagine the child-sized teacup of black rose tea is actually absinthe, &amp; subsequently I imagine myself hallucinating. In my imaginary hallucination I gaze upward &amp;notice several randomly arranged crystal door handles bolted to the ceiling. For a moment I am convinced that my will-to-power hallucination succeeded, but no. Those door handles are actually there. Approximately thirty of them. &quot;Each doorknob leads to a different time &amp;place,&quot; the lovely barista tells me, &quot;They''re all portals.&quot; I am absolutely convinced that Wolfsmane Hub houses some kind of secret magic, which is nice. I suppose it serves me right for scribbling away in the corner with my headphones on, but a black-clad woman with a veil covering half of her face takes the chair opposite of me &amp;adds it to her party''s table. I mistake her approach for an attempt at friendliness, &amp; so I smile. I guess I should have scowled instead. A woman I vaguely know (maybe her name is Angela) approaches my table &amp; so I remove my headphones in case she wants say, &quot;hello.&quot; Her body language suggests that she does not, but she seems to notice the gesture, &amp;probably feels obligated, now, to talk. Oops. She kneels down at the other end of the table &amp;rests her elbows on the glossy wood. There is no seat for her, obviously, since the veiled woman from before already took it. &quot;Hey there,&quot; I say, &amp; she says, &quot;Hi.&quot; &quot;I saw you at that party last night,&quot; I say, &amp; she nods. &quot;Oh, yeah.&quot; &quot;Did you stay long?&quot; I ask.&quot;Yeah, I ended up staying pretty late.&quot;&quot;Oh. How was the reading part?&quot; &quot;Um, good.&quot;Someone from another table passes Angela a ziplock bag with loose tobacco, rolling papers, &amp; individual filters. She begins to assemble a cigarette for herself out of these materials as we talk.&quot;Did you see my friend Tasha read?&quot; I ask her. &quot;Who?&quot; &quot;Um, she had her poem written all over her body, &amp;she got nakeder as it went on.&quot;&quot;Oh, no. I guess I missed that one.&quot;&quot;Oh.&quot; &quot;Sounds good though.&quot;&quot;Yeah.&quot; For a moment she becomes absorbed in rolling her cigarette, so I pick up my pen &amp;continue writing this story. Since life happens faster than my pen can wiggle, I''m still in the process of writing that bit about the vampiric crimson trim. I roll my neck &amp;stretch my shoulders. I notice, out of the corner of my eye, a small mirror the shape of a submarine window bolted onto the ceiling. First the crystal doorknobs, &amp;now this? At this point it becomes clear to me that Wolfsmane Hub seems to house the greatest ceiling in Olympia, &amp;I am always one to notice. I fully support good ceilings, because they promote looking up. People need to look up more often. &quot;I''m going to go smoke this, now,&quot; Angela says in reference to her cigarette, &amp;I say &quot;have fun.&quot; I thought about saying, &quot;I hope it doesn''t contribute to an early death for you,&quot; instead, but decided right away that it would be somewhat inappropriate. Angela leaves through the door. In her absence I start to consider all the things I''ve done today which might contribute to an early death for me:Not eating any vegetables.Not running or riding my bike.Not looking both ways before I cross the street (potentially habit-forming). Drinking a beer at 1:30 in the afternoon. Not calling my mother back.Not staying at home to watch Audrey Hepburn movies with my roommate. Not going to the doctor again about the headache I''ve had for six months. Not brushing my teeth until 6:45 in the evening. Judging from this list, it seems like the &quot;nots&quot; have it. The things I <em>don't</em> do seem to have a greater contribution to my possible early death. This realization forces me to jump to a somewhat cockamamie conclusion: if you just do everything, you''ll be fine. If you don''t do anything, though, you''re pretty much dead meat. I rise from my seat to investigate the mirror which is hanging from the ceiling.&nbsp; I stand directly beneath it, &amp;look up. &quot;This must be what people look like to the moon&quot; I suppose. &quot;They must look pretty pitiful from up there,&quot; I added, since the look I was making looked, in fact, pretty pitiful. In the corner adjacent to me, the veiled woman from before picks up a a guitar &amp;starts to perform her songs to Wolfsmane Hub''s patrons (now the audience). I want to despise the songs in the same way that I am trying to despise her, but I can't do it. I have to concede, because her songs are so delightful. I decide, then, that <em>she</em> is delightful, &amp; I begin to to project an equally delightful friendship forming between us. In our friendship we would walk up &amp;down Fifth Avenue, passing inside jokes back &amp; fourth. We'd be unnecessarily loud, so that everyone else on the street would feel left out from not knowing the context to our punch lines. In my projection she would always wear that black veil, since it''s currently emblematic to my understanding of her character. People would stop us in front of the Olympia Film Society &amp; ask, &quot;are you mourning?&quot; &nbsp;She'd answer, &quot;no, I'm evening!&quot; because she'd secretly be corny like that. Near midnight, Zosia &amp; Eliana enter the establishment. They stand out because of the bright, red &amp; orange sweaters they're wearing. Up to this point, the general consensus on fashion has been black, 1913 throwback outfits. As if this was some kind of super hip funeral wake. I smile because I'm happy to see them, &amp; I wave with just my pinky. Sans pinky, the gesture is reciprocated. They steal back the seat that the veiled woman took from my table earlier &amp; pull it up to my table. At first they share the one chair, until Zosia takes another vacant seat from a different table. Suddenly I've become the bane of my own existence. I realize how terribly impossible it is to maintain any kind of presence in this world. Empathy is purely situational. It cannot hop over fences. Opposite of the chair Zosia took is another lonesome stranger who is probably stewing about her red sweater the way I stewed about veil-girl's veil. A moment ago, I would have felt a deep, abiding compassion for his aloneness. But not anymore. I'm in pleasant company now, &amp; I can't spare a second to think of him. All my brainpower now is devoted to the construction of hilarious wit for entertaining. Eliana thinks that the definition of human ought to be, &quot;the ability to take something nonsensical &amp; extract meaning from it,&quot; because she was reading passages out of Kenneth Patchen's book, <em>In Search of the Candlelighters. </em>I disagree, &amp; my definition becomes, &quot;The inability to look at both of someone's eyes at the same time,&quot; because I was trying to do that with her, but couldn't. Zosia seems opposed to both our definitions, so hers defaults to, &quot;not choosing sides.&quot; Now that my bitterness has melted, I''ve become bitter at the puddle. Not because I enjoy it, necessarily, but because it bothers me that so much of my mental state is subject to the whim of external forces. I don''t like the way people turn all crazy &amp; sad as soon as winter begins (which happens to be now). A man in a studded, black drifter hat sings songs about hearts being broken in five places while we revel in witticisms. I ask Eliana what she thinks of this place, &amp; she says, &quot;It makes me happy, but in a really desperate way.&quot; By now the place is packed with people I wouldn't immediately refer to as strangers.&nbsp; Even when I don't know who they are. The patronage has transformed into real, twenty-first century Olympia human beings, in hooded sweatshirts, fanny packs &amp; knitted scarves. They aren't playing any decedent, bygone roles, which is as good as it is bad. &nbsp;I notice that several of the crystal door handles seem to be sprouting out of the soil in one of the plant pots. I think, perhaps I was short in just assuming that Wolfsmane Hub houses great magic. Perhaps this place is even responsible for <em>growing</em> it. There is a strange sensation of timelessness here, that seems to be growing stronger as the evening progresses. Where are we? What world is this? Who cares? In the center of the ceiling is a hand-painted clock with distorted, misplaced numbers. It does not tick. There is a sign hanging above the doorframe which reads, &quot;Please leave this door unlocked during business hours,&quot; but I'm sure what it means to say is &quot;The coffee costs money. The magic is free.&quot;I realize that Wolfsmane Hub seems to fulfill most of my expectations of what the spirit world might function like. In here, everyone seems a little bit not real, wandering back &amp; forth in conversation. Jokes keep bumping into secrets, while strangers morph into friends &amp; friends to strangers. The whole room has sleep in it's eyes, but there is no such thing as time to fret about, only this half-formed expectancy for the greatest good to happen. The greatest good happens when Colleen Johnson &amp; Onyx of Olympia take the stage as Polka Dot Dot. Every time this happens my heart explodes. Their lovely ukulele strums &amp; a'cappella melodies turn my eyelids to anchors. As potent as the multiple sticks of burning incense, their songs fill Wolfsmane Hub with the sleepiest kind of sublime. I have to fight away my desire to profess maudlin love at everyone in the room, since that would probably turn into an ugly mess tomorrow. Alas, my heart explodes, so as soon as their set ends Zosia, Eliana &amp; I grab hold of each others' hands &amp; begin to hum. Maybe we're trying to resurrect my overtaxed heart, or maybe we're just being strange because it's 2:25 in the morning. Our noises harmonize, &quot;It's the sound of the universe!&quot; Zosia exclaims. Eliana responds, &quot;There's not sound in space. There aren't any particles. The big bang was silent.&quot; We fall silent. One of the owners, who made the belated joke about my five-dollar bill being tacked on the wall earlier (I checked&ndash;it's still not there) notices that I was still here, in the very same corner, six hours later. However, over the course of the night I've evolved from the jaundiced spectator to the universe-humming spectacle. I'm surprised she recognized me. &quot;You're still here!&quot; she laughs. &quot;Wow, you'll be our first &amp; <em>last</em> customer!&quot;&quot;Yup, I''m not going anywhere,&quot; I joke, only I'm kind-of not joking. The night ends with a puppetry performance by Erin Tanner &amp; Colleen Johnson. In the performance, the world ends by means of every particle on Earth pulling apart in a single instant. A space cadet observes this catastrophe, &amp;realizes that the only way to get the Earth back together is by making the molecules fall back in love with each other. So he finds a map to love, &amp;navigates his way across the galaxy. Eventually, the map leads into him into the throat of a giant space-dragon. Moral: no map can lead you to love? I glean a strange kind of comfort from this sight. &nbsp;A handheld tape recorder plays the tape to the performance on a loops for several awkward moments after the puppet show ends. Claps are suspended. No one knows what to do. The map to love is at full mast, Erin Tanner bowing below it. Now we actually have to go home.The tape loops. It's the only sound left. One body breathing in deep, human sleep.</p>
