<p><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: smaller;"><span>Along Fourth Avenue and Jefferson Street, characters of all kinds find their way to the greatest treasure a parking lot can offer: Olympia''s most beloved artesian well. The very best water in Thurston County just might spring from that old pipe between spots forty-three and forty-four. Its neck peaks out from cement blocks, with water flowing outward into an almost heart-shaped pool before heading toward a nearby storm drain. A mural with stenciled images of well-goers watches over the humble pipe, reminding visitors of the collective responsibility urged in protecting a shared source of water.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: smaller;">On the warmest days, hundreds of people visit the well to fill up jugs and other water-tight containers. Over half of the users travel from outside of Olympia. While some folks visit for pleasure, necessity can be at least as much of a reason. At times, the artesian well provides water for families whose own wells have gone dry or lack a functioning pump. Residents concerned about the chlorinated water available through the city''s tap are drawn to the untreated nature of the well.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: smaller;">The water streams from the pipe as if it has no other choice but to remind us that the most valuable things in life can often be found beneath our very feet. For generations, groundwater brought to the surface by springs and artesian wells has provided people in our area with clean, untampered water. Our wells have carried on traditions shared by villages all over the world, where communities have been built around similar reservoirs, sustaining the hearts of societies.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: smaller;">A good hundred and fifty years ago, an artesian spring flowed along the Northeast corner of Fourth Avenue and Main Street (now known as Capitol Way). Families filled jugs with water and people gathered nearby to discuss the people, politics and events of the South Puget Sound. Over the next several decades, dozens of wells were drilled throughout the Olympia area. Most have since been capped, but several are still used by downtown businesses as part of their water systems.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: smaller;">Although most of the public water supplies in Thurston County don''t naturally spring above the Earth''s crust, all of them originate from groundwater sources. After rain falls to the ground, it''s filtered through mazes of sediment to replenish our natural groundwater supply.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: smaller;">As industrial activity persists and concrete extends its reach throughout the area, rainwater is blocked from its natural filtration system. The water must travel greater distances to find its way back underground, carrying pollutants en route and building the risk of contamination. Extra care must be taken to protect the groundwater, especially near storm drains that lead to vulnerable water masses.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: smaller;">The well near Fourth Avenue and Jefferson Street was drilled in the early 20th century to provide a train depot with water for steam locomotives. Incarnated for another generation, it supplied water to a downtown grocery store. Now, it lives in an otherwise barren lot owned by Seattle''s Diamond Parking Service.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: smaller;">Concerns have long rustled over the potential capping of the well. In 1996, community members formed Friends of Artesians, a citizen group that would work for years to preserve it. They raised funds to pay for monthly coliform testing and advocated for public access. They negotiated with government officials to keep the well flowing under agreements that they would make progress in finding a permanent location for a public well. After thirteen years of planning, fundraising and negotiating, they tired of the seemingly endless obstacles and announced that they would disband.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: smaller;">In a letter to the Mayor and City Council last November, Friends of Artesians founder Jim Ingersoll wrote, "Over many years, we have worked with city staff in good faith. At times, we''ve felt caught in an endless loop of planning with no real support, and no leader willing to step forward and solve problems. We have also received mixed messages about the City''s willingness to own the well. Fears about liability linger, even though we have responded to repeated requests to provide information about other cities that own and manage similar public wells."</span></span></p>
<p class="rteleft"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: smaller;">Without consistent stewards of the well, news unfurled that it would soon be capped. Friend of Artesians agreed to pay for the monthly testing through February of 2009, but thereafter, the well''s livelihood was uncertain.</span></span></p>
<p class="rtecenter"><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: smaller;">***</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: smaller;">On recent winter days, I found my way to that old pipe to fill my trusty bottle. Each visit, I spotted a sign announcing the well''s uncertain future and pondered as any concerned visitor might: <em>what could be done?</em> I was just beginning to learn about the history of local artesian springs and wells, but the larger matter of public access to clean water grasped me.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: smaller;">I learned that carbon date testing financed by Friends of Artesians suggested that some of the well-water could be upwards of 2,000 years old. So much amazement came when I realized I could hold water filtered over two millennia right there between my mittened hands.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: smaller;">News of a new citizen group advocating for a publicly-owned well soon diffused into our city. <em>It''s Still the Water</em>, as the group has tentatively been known, called for an open meeting at the Olympia Timberland Library.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: smaller;">On that mid-January afternoon, I settled onto the carpet of the library''s meeting room to hear from residents of Thurston County, community organizers and government employees. City council members Craig Ottavelli and Joan Machlis carried much of the discussion, urging citizens to take a lead in finding a permanent location for a public well. The city would be willing to pay for monthly coliform tests for the interim, administered by the county''s Public Utility District. Negotiations were planned between Diamond Parking, city and county officials, and the State Departments of Health and Ecology.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: smaller;">Fantastic news, I thought, as I departed from the library. But as I read further into the history of the well, I learned that Friends of Artesians had found encouragement in similar situations throughout their thirteen years, only to have other hurdles placed and carpets snagged from beneath their steady toes. Concerns about the safety of our water are most understandable, but great frustration can be found in the bureaucracy that''s been encountered through attempts to preserve free access to one of life''s most essential elements. The well wasn''t yet saved, but there was reason to be hopeful.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: smaller;">Besides, other cities like Ashland, Salt Lake City and Manitou Springs had public artesian wells. Why couldn''t we?</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: smaller;">Friends of the Artesians, working with the City of Olympia, had attempted to acquire public ownership of the Fourth Avenue lot from Diamond Parking in the late 90s. While buying the space outright wasn''t an immediately viable option, Diamond had agreed to consider trading parking lots with the city. It seemed like a reasonable enough solution for many. The city surveyed their property and offered lots they found to be suitable trades, but Diamond stepped back, explaining that they wanted an agreement to operate all of the city''s downtown lots. The practicality of trading withered, and the search for a new site for a public well began.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: smaller;">A potential site was found on land owned by the Port of Olympia. After several years of negotiations and testing, building permits were granted by the Departments of Health and Ecology. But one unanswered component endured: when might the city follow through with taking ownership of the well?</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: smaller;">With years gone by, Friends of Artesians exhausted of the wait. And now, as rumors that Diamond Parking might be putting the lot up for sale emerge, advocates for a public well are weary of the wait, too.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: smaller;">Nudge as we might, something stronger is to behold. There''s a fuel in the history of our community''s connection to artesian water and the commitment to preserve it.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: smaller;">Ninety feet below the concrete lot on Fourth Avenue, water from our aquifer begins its travels up the aged but sturdy pipe. The pressure created by soil and rock causes the water to rise most magnificently when it finds a meaningful path.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: smaller;">If the well may offer a lesson: applying enough pressure in the most genuine forms, especially when done collectively, can create bounty for all. Not only is it still the water, it''s still <em>our</em> water. That, I hope, is something worth protecting.-nicki sabalu</span></span></p>
