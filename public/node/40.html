    <p>One Sunday eve I was riding around downtown on my bike just full of energy, wishing I had something to do, when far off in the distance I heard it: drumming, fairly rhythmic/polyrhythmic drumming.<br />
I followed the sound ‘til I got to the Cherry Street Loft, that huge open space now owned by Fishtale brewery.  Then I remembered: yes, Samba Practice, Sunday eves, 5:00.<br />
SambaOlyWa is a local open-community Samba band complete with dancers often doing steps I do in my sleep.  I’ve seen them performing since I moved here almost 5 years ago now, and I’ve known one of the leaders, David Moseley, for a few years through folks at Evergreen.  I expressed my desire to dance or drum, and he always encouraged me to come on down some Sunday.<br />
And I kept on saying: I’m gonna go do that one of these Sundays real soon, I promise.<br />
Trouble for me was: should I dance, or should I drum?<br />
I just couldn’t decide,<br />
So I did neither.<br />
Years of West African dancing in NYC certainly would have made it easy to jump in and dance, and I do love dancing so much.  But oh the drumming!  And all those awesome women drummers just holding it down – I wanted to do that, too.  After all, drumming is what got me into dancing.  But I’d never dedicated myself to drum playing, only through my body.<br />
What a dilemma – my two loves, and I’d have to pick one or the other.  What to do, what to do?<br />
And there, that Sunday eve, it became clear: you should take all that energy you got and go up those stairs and play along with those drums.<br />
So I did.<br />
Though I love the snare drum, in Brazil called a caixa (pronounced kaisha), I chose to start with the tamborim, a small high-pitched sharp drum head played with a specially made splayed plastic stick thingy called a beater (ouch).  The advantage, as I saw it, was that with this little instrument held up in my hands I could still dance almost as much as I could without it, only I had to maintain my part.<br />
Weeks went by and I was generally having lots of fun, even breaking out in dance steps now and then.  I even got to play a few short gigs with the band.<br />
Folks kept mentioning the impending Procession rehearsals, at which point people who wanted to be part of the band and dancers for the Procession of the Species would show up.  The band members would say: Just wait!<br />
I was learning the breaks and the nuances of different leaders, as well as the nuances of the rhythms overall.  While there are profound similarities between West African rhythms and Samba, the differences are significant and quixotic, and required me to learn a new balance.  I was slowly beginning to zone into other parts of the band while holding my own.<br />
It was warming around to Spring and daylight savings time was about to commence.<br />
It was the second Sunday in early March when I arrived a bit late to rehearsal.  I could hear a mighty thundering as I came up the stairs, and when my head cleared the top step I saw before me an army of people.  From the 10 or 12 usual drummers and 20-25 usual dancers in the cavernous space, there was suddenly hardly any free space anywhere.<br />
There had to be 50 drummers, and at least 100 dancers, Moms, Dads, young, old, even little kids, as in shorter than me.  The loft was full.  I was amazed.  I ran up to the front spot with the other tamborim players and got immediately into the groove.  The roar of all those drums - big huge surdus and cutters, timbals and caixas, shakers and bells - rolling on behind me eventually turned into waves of melodic rhythm that swept me into another zone, and all I could see ahead was rows of clad bodies moving in arcs and patterns...Watching dance steps I knew well get worked out into the music, I moved my whole being into the rhythm and danced in my place, becoming part of the roar.<br />
For the Procession this year the band is in the Earth element, so the steering committee chose Zebras to be the group theme costume.  Nowadays folks show up in the early stages of Zebra gear and we go outside to practice playing and marching and dancing around.  Occasionally we get an impromptu audience, and occasionally we get sunshine.  We get better and tighter each week, and excitement about costumes begins to build, as do the costumes themselves.  Each week more layers of black and white stripes and headdresses show up.  The mass of us all moving along striped in black and white ought to be quite striking, and getting the crowds along the parade route jumping and shaking their bodies will be a good deed for the whole town.<br />
The Procession is really an amazing undertaking that involves art and music, joy and lots of  non-verbal communication.  Folks go down to the Procession studio and make costumes together, coordinate dances together, and it is all put on by our own community working together.  Come rain or shine, there will be lots of color and enthusiasm parading through Olympia on April 25.<br />
And SambaOlyWa will be providing dancing cheer for all ~ and we plan to see you out there, dancing along with the rest of us!</p>
